**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**

- **Each cell MUST be RUN ONCE Denoted by üî¥** or you'll accidentally queue duplicate jobs.
- **Other cells can be RUN to check status and download results Denoted by üü¢**
- The first run will return a **job_id** for each batch ‚Äì **don‚Äôt mix them up** or subsequent cells won‚Äôt work.
- Uncomment each invocation **one at a time**, and **run it**.
- After running, **copy the generated job_id** into the class variable below, then move on to the next cell.
- **DO NOT** run the next cell until **all previous jobs** have completed.
- Each batch can take ~24 h. You may shut down and come back: to check status, use the job_id you saved.

# First run: invoke and capture job_id

```python
# obj.invoke_job()
```

# ‚û°Ô∏è After running, copy the printed job_id here:

```python
# obj.job_id = "PASTE_FIRST_GENERATED_JOB_ID_HERE"
```

**Check status of your CharGen job**
Uses the job_id you just set
Run this cell anytime to see if it‚Äôs done
DO NOT proceed until status == "succeeded" or final failure

```python
status = client.batches.get(obj.job_id)
print(f"Job {obj.job_id} status: {status.status}")
```

**Check all Batch jobs**

```python
jobs = client.batches.list()
len(jobs.data)
jobs.data
```
